# A tool for measuring USB cable resistance

![USB cable tester](figures/usb-cable-tester.jpg)

I'm making a tool for measuring USB cable resistance very similar to the
[FemtoCow's cable resistance tester][1]. I will publish the design files here
as soon as I test a prototype.

In the mean time, you can read my blog post about [measuring USB cables][2].
